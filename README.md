COMP30027-ASMT2report.docx: Detailed report and result analysis

## How to Run
# Traditional Models (Random Forest, kNN, SVM, MLP)
Open either Models_Original.ipynb or Models_Optimized.ipynb

Run all cells in order

Final predictions are saved as submission_<model>.csv

# CNN with Spatial Transformer (CNN+STN)
Detailed readme file for cnn is written in the file named "Project"
